Description: Command line personal finances manager
 Keeping track of personal finances is an incredibly boring task, and if
 you don't have much money then juggling it can be tricky.  When looking
 at the existing software out there to manage accounts it's frequently
 highly complex and top heavy.  Fin - an abbreviation of "financials" -
 is an attempt to do the opposite of what most accounting software does,
 and that's to make things incredibly simple and quick.  Logging a
 transaction or viewing your current balance should take no more than a
 few seconds.  This means less time wasted on bureaucracy and more time
 spent on what you really want to be doing.  Fin can import and export
 to CSV files, Emacs org mode tables and GnuCash.
